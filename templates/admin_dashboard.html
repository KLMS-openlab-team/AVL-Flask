		In computer science, an AVL tree (named after inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis) is a self-balancing binary
		search tree. It was the first such data structure to be invented. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child
		subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to
		restore this property. Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst
		cases, where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation. Insertions and deletions may require
		the tree to be rebalanced by one or more tree rotations.
		<br>
		<br>
		The AVL tree is named after its two Soviet inventors, Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis, who published it
		in their 1962 paper "An algorithm for the organization of information".
		<br>
		<br>

		AVL trees are often compared with red–black trees because both support the same set of operations and take
		O(logn) time for the basic operations. For lookup-intensive applications, AVL trees are faster than red–black
		trees because they are more strictly balanced. Similar to red–black trees, AVL trees are height-balanced.
		<br>
		<br>

		Balance factor:
		In a binary tree the balance factor of a node X is defined to be the height difference

		Balance Factor = (Height of Left Subtree - Height of Right Subtree) or (Height of Right Subtree - Height of Left
		Subtree)

		The self balancing property of an avl tree is maintained by the balance factor. The value of balance factor
		should always be -1, 0 or +1.

		<br>
		Complexities of Different Operations on an AVL Tree:
		<br>
		Insertion:

		O(log n)
		<br>
		Deletion:

		O(log n)
		<br>
		Search:

		O(log n)
